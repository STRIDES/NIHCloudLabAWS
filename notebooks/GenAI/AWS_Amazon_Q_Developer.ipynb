    "# Introduction to Amazon Q Developer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty Level: Beginner**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Q Developer is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) powered conversational assistant designed to enhance the \n",
    "software development process, particularly within the AWS ecosystem. Amazon Q can assist with various coding tasks such as providing inline code completions, generating new code, and scanning for security vulnerabilities. Amazon Q Developer can be accessed through an IDE such as VSCode and JupyterLab or through the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model that Amazon Q utilizes has been supplemented with the high-quality AWS content, allowing users to ask questions\n",
    "about AWS architecture, AWS resources, best practices, documentation, and support. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In this tutorial, we will be running the **free tier of Amazon Q Developer**. You will not incur charges for the first 50 interactions with the chatbot each month. To understand the pricing plan of Amazon Q, please refer to the information found in this [link](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/pricing/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the capabilities of Amazon Q Developer and learn how to access the tool through an IDE \n",
    "* Engage with Amazon Q Developer and ask code-related queries\n",
    "* Implement inline code completions \n",
    "* Generate new code snippets based on specific requirements \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this tutorial, you will need access to an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Popular options include SageMaker Studio, VSCode, and JupyterLab. Note that installation steps and certain features of Amazon Q Developer may vary across different IDEs. For instance, if you choose to install Amazon Q Developer locally through VSCode you will be required to create an AWS Builder ID profile which includes creating a username and password. To learn more about AWS Builder ID visit the following link [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/create-aws_builder_id.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:** SageMaker Studio offers a wide range of machine learning functionalities, including tools for training and tuning models. However, deploying endpoints in SageMaker Studio can be very expensive. We strongly recommend using Amazon Bedrock for model testing and Generative AI (GenAI) work to manage costs more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get Started",
    " In this tutorial, we will run through use cases that showcase many features Amazon Q Developer provides such as inline code completions, generating new code, and scanning for security vulnerabilities through the use of 'Quick Actions':\n",
    "\n",
    "- **/fix:** Corrects errors in code.\n"
    "- **/optimize:** Suggests optimization methods.\n"
    "- **/explain:** Explains code snippets and provides enhancement suggestions.\n"
    "- **/test:** Builds unit tests to evaluate and test code.\n"
