    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Q Developer is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) powered conversational assistant designed to enhance the \n",
    "software development process, particularly within the AWS ecosystem. Amazon Q can assist with various coding tasks such as providing inline code completions, generating new code, and scanning for security vulnerabilities. Amazon Q Developer can be accessed through an IDE such as VSCode and JupyterLab or through the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model that Amazon Q utilizes has been supplemented with the high-quality AWS content, allowing users to ask questions\n",
    "about AWS architecture, AWS resources, best practices, documentation, and support. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be running the **free tier of Amazon Q Developer**. You will not incur charges for the first 50 interactions with the chatbot each month. To understand the pricing plan of Amazon Q, please refer to the information found in this [link](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/pricing/).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this tutorial, you will need access to an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) popular options include SageMaker AI Studio, VSCode, and JupyterLab. Note that installation steps, pricing, and certain features of Amazon Q Developer may vary across different IDEs and pricing tiers.
