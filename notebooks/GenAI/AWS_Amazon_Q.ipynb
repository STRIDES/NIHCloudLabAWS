    "\n",
    "**Difficulty Level: Beginner**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Q Developer is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) powered conversational assistant designed to enhance the \n",
    "software development process, particularly within the AWS ecosystem. Amazon Q can assist with various coding tasks such as providing inline code completions, generating new code, and scanning for security vulnerabilities. Amazon Q Developer can be accessed through an IDE such as VSCode and JupyterLab or through the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model that Amazon Q utilizes has been supplemented with the high-quality AWS content, allowing users to ask questions\n",
    "about AWS architecture, AWS resources, best practices, documentation, and support. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the capabilities of Amazon Q Developer and learn how to access the tool through an IDE \n",
    "* Engage with Amazon Q Developer and ask code-related queries\n",
    "* Implement inline code completions \n",
    "* Generate new code snippets based on specific requirements \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this tutorial, you will need access to SageMaker Studio. \n",
    "Alternatively, you may install Amazon Q Developer in an alternative IDE such as VSCode or JupyterLab. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Amazon Q Developer on SageMaker Studio\n",
    "1. Navigate to SageMaker Studio and create a domain\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In order to make Amazon Q Developer available within the JupyterLab, you will need to modify the IAM permissions associated with the SageMaker ExecutionRole. You will find the domain name in your SageMaker Studio launch page. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Navigate to IAM and search for the execution role pertaining to your SageMaker domain. The execution role will be named AmazonSageMaker-ExecutionRole-(SageMaker domain id)\n",

    "5. Add the following policy to the IAM role: \n",
    "\n",
    "```JSON\n",
    "\t\t{\n",
    "\t\t\t\"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n",
    "\t\t\t\"Action\": [\n",

    "6. Review and save your changes\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](../../Q-iam-policy-review.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Open your SageMaker studio UI and create a JupyterLab Space\n",
