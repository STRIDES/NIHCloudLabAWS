Create a simple Snakefile for a bioinformatics workflow using Snakemake and conda, including:

- Trimmomatic: Trim and clean raw sequencing data.
- FastQC: Perform quality control on trimmed data.

Requirements:

- Trimmomatic Rules: Process all input files in the raw_data directory.
- FastQC Rules: Run only on trimmed data.

Conda Configuration:
- Include conda configurations for each tool.
- Use a single environment.yml file for the entire workflow.
- Snakemake 8.25.5 is already installed. Do not include this in the yml file

Input Data:
- Unzipped FASTQ files in {input_directory}/data.

Deliverables:
- Snakefile with specified rules and configurations.
- environment.yml file with dependencies.
