I'll help you fix and improve the code. Here's the corrected version with error handling, input validation, and better organization:

```

Key improvements made:

Added proper error handling for file operations

Added input validation for FASTA format

Improved sequence parsing with better handling of empty lines and whitespace

Added documentation strings for all functions

Added sequence ID validation

Implemented proper cleanup of sequence data (removing whitespace, handling case)

Added progress messages for user feedback

Added return codes for the main function

Added creation of output directory if it doesn't exist

Added sorting of sequence IDs for consistent output

Improved memory efficiency by using lists for sequence building

Added validation for empty files and invalid sequences

Usage example:

# Example FASTA file (sequences.fasta):
# >Sequence1
# ATCGATCG
# >Sequence2
# GCTAGCTA
# GCTAGCTA

# Running the script will create sequence_lengths.csv:
# Sequence ID,Sequence Length
# Sequence1,8
# Sequence2,16

Copy

python
The script now handles various edge cases and provides better error messages when something goes wrong. It also validates the input data to ensure it's in the correct FASTA format before processing.
