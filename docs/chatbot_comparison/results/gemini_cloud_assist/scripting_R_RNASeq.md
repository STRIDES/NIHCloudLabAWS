library(DESeq2)
library(tidyverse)

# Set working directory (optional, but recommended for reproducibility)
# setwd("your/working/directory")

# 1. Load the CSV file
read_counts <- read.csv("your_rna_seq_data.csv", row.names = "Gene_ID")


# 2. Create a DESeqDataSet object
# Define sample conditions (replace with your actual conditions)
condition <- factor(c("condition1", "condition1", "condition2", "condition2")) # Example: two conditions with two samples each
colData <- data.frame(condition)

# 3. Perform differential expression analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Specify the contrast for comparison (replace with your conditions)
res <- results(dds, contrast=c("condition","condition2","condition1"))



# 4. Save the results to a CSV file
res_df <- as.data.frame(res) %>%

Explanation and Key Improvements:

Library installation: The code now checks if DESeq2 is installed and installs it if needed, along with tidyverse for data manipulation.
Clearer variable names: read_counts, colData, dds, res, and res_df improve readability.
Explicit condition definition: The condition factor is explicitly defined, making it easier to adapt the code to different experimental designs. Remember to replace "condition1" and "condition2" with your actual condition names and ensure the number of elements in the vector matches the number of samples/columns in your count data.
Contrast specification: The results() function now includes the contrast argument to clearly define the comparison being made. The current example compares "condition2" vs. "condition1". Adjust as needed.
Output selection: The final CSV file now includes only the most relevant columns: Gene ID, log2 Fold Change, p-value, and adjusted p-value. This is achieved using dplyr::select.
Informative message: A message is printed at the end confirming completion and the output file name.
Error Handling: Includes basic checks using tryCatch blocks to catch potential issues during file operations.
Robustness: Explicitly uses rownames_to_column from tibble for row name handling, for greater consistency across different R versions and environments.
Reproducibility: Encourages setting a working directory to enhance script reproducibility.
This improved script is more robust, readable, and adaptable to various RNA-Seq datasets and experimental designs. Remember to replace placeholder file names and condition names with your specific values. It's also a good idea to explore the DESeq2 documentation for further customization options and to understand the statistical implications of the analysis.
