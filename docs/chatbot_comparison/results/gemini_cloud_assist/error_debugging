Key Corrections and Explanations:

Output Field Names: In the samtools_sort task, the output file was defined with the name "sorted.bam", but the workflow was attempting to access it as samtools_sort.sorted_bam. This has been corrected by changing the task's output name to output_sorted_bam. The workflow now correctly references samtools_sort.output_sorted_bam.

samtools sort Command: The samtools sort command had incorrect syntax for output redirection. The -o flag should precede the output filename. It's been changed from samtools sort ${bam_file} -o sorted.bam to samtools sort -o sorted.bam ${bam_file}.

samtools index Output: The output file for samtools index was hardcoded as "sorted.bam.bai". This would be problematic if the input BAM had a different name. It has been changed to ${sorted_bam}.bai, which dynamically generates the index filename based on the input BAM, ensuring the correct .bai file is created for any input BAM file name.

Memory Specification: The runtime blocks in both tasks had memory specified as "4G" and "2G". WDL 1.0 requires memory units (e.g., GB, MB). This has been corrected to "4 GB" and "2 GB".

With these changes, the WDL script should now execute correctly, producing a sorted BAM file and its corresponding index. It's also more robust and adaptable to different input BAM file names.
