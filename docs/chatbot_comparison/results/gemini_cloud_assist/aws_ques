AI: How can I create and test a RAG system on AWS?

You can create and test a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system on AWS using a combination of services. A common approach involves:

Storage and Retrieval (Vector Database/Embeddings):

Amazon OpenSearch Service: Can be used to store and search vector embeddings of your knowledge base documents.
Amazon Aurora with pgvector: Postgres extension for vector search directly within your database.
Other Vector Databases: Consider services like Pinecone, Weaviate, or Chroma (often integrated with AWS).
Large Language Model (LLM):

Amazon Bedrock: Provides access to foundation models (FMs) like Jurassic and Titan, suitable for the generation step in RAG.
Amazon SageMaker JumpStart: Deploy and fine-tune open-source LLMs.
Hugging Face on SageMaker: Another option for deploying open-source LLMs.
Workflow Orchestration:

AWS Lambda: For serverless functions to handle retrieval, prompt engineering, and response generation.
Amazon Step Functions: Orchestrate complex RAG workflows, including error handling and retries.
Testing and Evaluation:

Manual Testing: Initially, test with a curated set of queries.
Automated Evaluation: Use metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, or METEOR to assess the quality of generated responses. Build a test harness using Lambda or other compute services.
Example Workflow:

A user query is received.
An embedding of the query is generated (potentially using an LLM or embedding model deployed on SageMaker).
The embedding is used to query the vector database (OpenSearch, Aurora/pgvector, etc.) to retrieve relevant documents.
The retrieved documents and the original query are combined into a prompt for the LLM (Bedrock, JumpStart, etc.).
The LLM generates a response, augmented with information from the retrieved documents.
Data and Analytics: What are the key features of Amazon SageMaker for data science workflows?

Amazon SageMaker offers a comprehensive suite of tools for data science workflows:

Data Preparation: SageMaker Data Wrangler for data exploration, cleaning, and feature engineering. SageMaker Feature Store for managing and sharing features.
Model Building: SageMaker Studio Notebooks, pre-built containers for popular frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.), and bring-your-own container options. Automated model tuning (SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning).
Model Training: Distributed training, managed spot instances for cost optimization, and experiment tracking.
Model Deployment: Easy deployment to endpoints for real-time inference or batch transformations. Support for A/B testing, autoscaling, and model monitoring.
MLOps: SageMaker Pipelines for building and managing ML workflows. Model Registry for model versioning and lineage.
Compute Services: How do you configure Auto Scaling for EC2 instances in AWS?

Launch Configuration: Define a launch template or launch configuration specifying the AMI, instance type, storage, and other settings for your EC2 instances.
Auto Scaling Group: Create an Auto Scaling group and associate the launch template/configuration.
Scaling Policies: Configure scaling policies to define how the Auto Scaling group should scale in response to changes in demand.
Dynamic Scaling: Scale based on metrics like CPU utilization, request count, or queue length.
Scheduled Scaling: Scale at specific times or intervals.
Manual Scaling: Adjust the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group manually.
Health Checks: Configure health checks to ensure that Auto Scaling replaces unhealthy instances.
Load Balancing: Integrate your Auto Scaling group with a load balancer (e.g., Elastic Load Balancing) to distribute traffic across your instances.
