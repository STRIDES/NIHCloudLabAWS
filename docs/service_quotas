If try to spin up a VM and you get a Service Quota Error, then you can request that an exception be granted. To do so, go to `Services > Service Quotas > Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2`. Then you can search for `On-Demand` and select the quota you need lifted. Select the quota name (e.g. Running On-Demand G and VT Instances), select `Request quota increase`, then change the quota value (e.g. 1 or more), then click `Request`.
