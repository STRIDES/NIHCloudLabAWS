### Obtaining your Short Term Access Keys for Intramural Cloud Lab Users
If you are an NIH intramural user, you can access your Short Term Access Keys (STAKs) at the same place you access the AWS console (aim.nih.gov).
Click `Short Term Access Keys` and then you can authenticate using any of the three Options. 
You can either paste in the text from Option 1 to your terminal window, or you can use `aws configure` and paste in the Access Key and Secret Access Keys individually. 
At some point you probably need to use aws configure to set your default region. You can also set your default region using `aws configure set region <region>`.
